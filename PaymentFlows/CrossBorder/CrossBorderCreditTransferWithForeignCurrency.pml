== Initiation of Payment Obligation ==
|||
Hnote over IGRA
The Debtor and the Creditor have entered into an agreement (or obligation, such as a web purchase, a commercial contract, a securities deal, .....)
which bounds the Debtor to pay the Creditor an agreed amount of money through a cross-border credit transfer, executed through correspondent banks.
In this scenario, the Debtor has an account in a different currency than the currency of the payment, requiring a FOREX, which will be executed 
by the DebtorAgent before initiation of the interbank transfer.

== Payment Clearing ==
Hnote over IDRA
The DebtorAgent instructs the payment to the beneficiary (the Creditor) through a credit transfer to the CreditorAgent.
Both DebtorAgent and CreditorAgent do not have a direct relationship in the currency of the credit transfer, 
and will therefore use the "COVER" payment method, through their correspondents (or Reimbursement Agents)

== Payment Settlement ( through COVER Method ) ==
Hnote over DA #DodgerBlue
The DebtorAgent issues an interbank credit transfer (COVER Method)to the

the credit transfers in the currency as defined in the payment obligation
